\frametitle{Evaluation}
We tested the prototype in the following configurations:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item One process on a local\footnote{a machine with Intel Core i7-4790 3.6 GHz processor, 32 GB of RAM and Intel 535 SSD storage} machine
		\item Eight processes on a local machine
		\item On RSC Tornado using 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 nodes
	\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Conclusion}
Our main takeaways are as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Necessarily support for efficient distributed compilation
		\item Several big functions can be bottleneck the analysis process
		\item LLVM not optimized for distributed scenarios
		\item Single-core optimizations may be difficulties for HPC version
	\end{itemize}
