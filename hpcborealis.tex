	There are two main modes Borealis supports as a compiler replacement: compilation and linking

\frametitle{Distributed compilation}
There are several ways to distributed compilation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Compilation on the Lustre storage
	\item Distribution of intermediate build tree to the processing nodes
	\item Distribution of copies of the analyzed project
\end{itemize}

	We decided to distribute different SMT queries to different nodes/cores

	Borealis performs analysis on an LLVM IR module, which means there are three options of how one can distribute the work:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Module level
	\item Function level
	\item Instruction level
\end{itemize}

There are two ways how one can distribute functions between several processes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Static distribution
		\item Dynamic distribution
